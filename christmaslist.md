## Dear Santa

This year I've been ever so good, my halo is only a little bit crooked. I've
worked really hard to achieve world peace and made sure that the Large
Hadron Collider worked for most of the year.

I would like some of the following:

 * [Reflective Running singlet](http://www.runireland.com/products/vizion-bib-0)
 * [Innov-8 Road-X 233 shoes](http://www.wiggle.co.uk/inov-8-road-x-233-shoes/) (size 9)
 * [ITunes gift voucher](http://www.apple.com/itunes/gifts/)
 * [Greenspot 12 Year-Old Pure Pot Still](http://www.celticwhiskeyshop.com/Greenspot_12_Year_Old_Pure_Pot_Still-z-product-product-85-context-promotionalgroup-page-1.htm)
 * [White Tea Shaving Cream](http://www.executive-shaving.co.uk/shaving/eshave-shaving-cream/white-tea-shaving-cream.php) updated link
 * [Assorted travel kit](http://www.executive-shaving.co.uk/shaving/gift-sets/eshave-mini-kit.php) updated link
 * and a surprise

I'll leave out some carrots for Rudolph and David has some Brandy that will
blow your head off. I'll borrow some of that to leave out for you.

Thanks

Michael.
