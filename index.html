  <h1 class="thin">Hi, I'm Mike.</h1>
  <h2 class="thin">I'm a programmer, fixer upper and general IT guy.</h2>
  <p>I enjoy tinkering with things, looking under the covers to see how they work,
  and then using that knowledge to improve them.</p>
  <p>I have worked in the public and private sector in Ireland doing support,
  system administration and programming.</p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>I have used PHP and Ruby to make intranet and web facing sites. Along with
  these, I used HTML, CSS, Javascript, bash, perl, sed and awk. I have used
  cakePHP quite a lot and also dabbled with Sinatra for some projects.</p>
  <p>I use git for all my version control needs now but I did play around with
  SVN and Mercurial in the past.</p>
  <p>I have used a number of SQL variants including MySQL, PostgreSQL and MSSQL
  but I haven't had to dig too deep into their performance.</p>
  <p>I am comfortable working in Linux, Windows and MacOSX environments having
  supported all of them on desktop and server platforms.</p>
  <p>I also have experience administering Cisco networking devices from
  switches to routers to PIX firewalls.</p>
