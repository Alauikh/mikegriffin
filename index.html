<h2>Hi, I'm Mike and I'm a programmer, fixer and general IT guy.</h2>
<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/green_hair.jpeg" alt="I had green hair once" style="float:right">
<p>I'm currently working with the National Museum of Ireland in Collins Barracks. I 
help to look after the IT infrastructure for four public sites and a number of other
offices. 
<p>Before this I worked with a company called BlueCarrot which did PHP
development and hosting. We worked on a very large web based system for the
GAA.

<h3>Skills</h3>
<p>I mainly use PHP, and in particular the CakePHP framework. With these skills
I have been exposed to HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have also made use of Ruby
with Ruby on Rails and Sinatra.</p>
<p>I have worked with MySQL, MSSQL and SQLite databases.</p>
