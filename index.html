  <h1 class="thin">Hi, I'm Mike.</h1>
  <h2 class="thin">I'm a programmer, fixer upper and general IT guy.</h2>
  <p>I work for the National Museum of Ireland in Collins Barracks. I am a member of
  the ICT Department and am mainly responsible for the netwotk and server 
  infrastructure.</p> 
  <p>I have developed some in house applications to make it easier for staff to
  share information and get their work done. One of the projects was to create
  a display to inform visitors of upcoming events in the Museum. This was
  completed using PHP for the backend and HTML, CSS and Javascript to showcase
  the events.</p>
  <p>Before this I worked with a company called BlueCarrot which did PHP
  development and hosting. We worked on a very large web based system for the
  GAA.</p>

  <h3>Skills</h3>
  <p>I mainly use PHP, and in particular the CakePHP framework. With these skills
  I have been exposed to HTML, CSS and Javascript. I have also made use of Ruby
  with Ruby on Rails and Sinatra.</p>
  <p>I have worked with MySQL, MSSQL and SQLite databases.</p>

  <h3>Look at my work</h3>
