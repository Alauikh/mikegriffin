I was installing CakePHP on a Windows server under IIS7 and I kept getting the 
error saying that the tmp directory and the tmp/cache directory were unwriteable.
A quick search brought back this stack overflow post with a quick neat solution.

Add full access permissions to the "Everyone" group for the directory. I found
that it had to be Everyone on the local machine instead of Everyone in the Active
Directory domain for it to work.
