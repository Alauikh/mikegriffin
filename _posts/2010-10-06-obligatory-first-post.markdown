Welcome to the new home of my writings and ravings. I will be using this space
to make notes of things that I like, don't like and have learned over the
course of work and life in general. It's likely to be a rag tag bunch of posts
with no discernable pattern.

If you're so inclined, you can see the source that powers all this at
[GitHub]("http://www.github.com/mgriffin/mg"). Feel free to fork it or
watch it and see how it develops over time. At the moment it's a very simple
blogging engine but I have plans, oh yes I do!

So here we go, off on a new adventure, all over again. Until I get comments
working, you can keep in contact with me on
[twitter]("http://www.twitter.com/griffinmike") or by
[email]("mailto:iam@mikegriffin.ie")
