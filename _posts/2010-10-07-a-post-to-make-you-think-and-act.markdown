[Memoirs of a Bullied Kid](http://www.danoah.com/2010/10/memoirs-of-bullied-kid.html)

I found this article this morning on [Hacker
News](http://news.ycombinator.com/) and as I read through the first part of it,
I was thining that it was a typical sob story of how someone gets bullied and
manages to pull through it and he was lucky and found the right people when he
needed them and all the usual things that you get in a story like that.  But
then I read some more and it wasn't like that. Yes he was lucky and something
clicked for him after a few years of hell. Yes he mostly managed to get over it
and put it behind him. But the best part of the article for me is the last part
of it.

In the last part he says that we all have a responsibility to eveyone we come
in contact with whether on a regular or not so regular basis. A responsibility
to help and nurture and just be there so that someone knows that there is at
least one person that isn't going to be in their circle of hell. Someone that
can help them out of it. It doesn't take much, a touch, a word, a conversation.
Just being there can sometimes be enough. 

So go ahead and read it and see if it changes your ideas on bullying and being
bullied. It did with me.
