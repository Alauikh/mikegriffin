I've hosted my own email for the past few years, going through setting it up, moving the config to puppet, having it crash
and burn, recreating it and reimporting all the old mails. I don't have the time to do this any more so a short while ago
I moved it all, lock stock and barrel to [Fastmail](http://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14043913).

I could have moved it back to Gmail, but I wanted to try out something different and I'd heard a lot of good things about
[Fastmail](http://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14043913).

They have a nice easy method to import mails from an IMAP account as well as from some of the large common email hosters.
After a few hours, everything was imported and I had to change over the DNS entries. This was the worst bit. What would
happen if I did something wrong here? Would I even know that mail was falling through the cracks?

After a few days and seeing mails still being delivered, I called it a success. I set up the new account details on my phone
and laptop and I was all moved.

Overall, it was a simple process with very little that could go wrong once the excellent instructions were followed. I plumped
up for the personal enhanced package for $40 per year so that I could use a personal domain and get 15GB storage.

If you feel like giving it a go, try it out using [this referral link](http://www.fastmail.com/?STKI=14043913)
