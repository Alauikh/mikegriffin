Some people have told me that I have Grammar Nazi tendencies and that I should
just relax and let the ignorant folk talk in their own ignorant language.
Sometimes I manage to find someone who is every bit as bad as me, but somehow
manages to get their complaints across in a fantastically humourous way. 

One of those people has a site called 
[Hyperbole and a Half](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/) 
and she made a post one day about
[the Alot](http://hyperboleandahalf.blogspot.com/2010/04/alot-is-better-than-you-at-everything.html).
As you can imagine, this struck a chord with lots of other people and it was
only a matter of time until
[this](http://maiyamayhem.blogspot.com/2010/06/alot-of-fun.html) happened.

Yes, indeedy, a real live Alot. Fantastic!
