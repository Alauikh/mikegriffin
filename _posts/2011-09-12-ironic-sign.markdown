I was driving along the road last Saturday and out of the corner of my eye, I spotted this sign. I knew the style
of it so I had to go back and see if it was what I thought it was. Indeed it was. Slightly ironic seeing as the
entrance wasn't particularly concealed and definitely not as well concealed as the sign.

For those that can't make it out, it says

**CAUTION**

**CONCEALED**

**ENTRANCE**

**AHEAD**
