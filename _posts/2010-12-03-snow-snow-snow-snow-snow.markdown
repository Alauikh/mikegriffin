I went for a few runs in the Phoenix Park at lunchtime over the last few days and took a few photos. There were hundreds of people out sliding on everything from snowboards to traffic cones, bin bags to car bumpers.

I found the only live snowman in the park too, all the rest had their heads knocked off.

And finally some photos from around the house in Celbridge. I don't think the lettuce will survive...
