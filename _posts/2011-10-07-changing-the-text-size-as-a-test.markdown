I was browsing through [Hacker News](http://http://news.ycombinator.com/)
earlier and I saw a post from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com)
titled [16 pixels For Body Copy. Anything Less Is A Costly Mistake](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/07/16-pixels-body-copy-anything-less-costly-mistake/).

I had a look through the CSS for this site and sure enough, it had been set 
at 13px. So as a test, I set off and changed it to 16px.

Here's a before and after comparison. Let me know what you think in the
comments.
