I got a new pair of runners over the weekend in Elverys. They were on sale, down to €60. The last time I bought runners in Elverys, I got two pairs of the model before this one and, combined, they lasted for about 18 months. In fact I still have one of the pairs lying around somewhere with most of the sole worn away.

The only problem I had with them before was their amazing ability to pick up stones. And these ones are no different! Have a look at the photo and see why. The sole is a great criss cross with perfectly shaped holes to fit a piece of gravel. This happens on almost every run and after a while you get used to the clicking of the stone on the road. The sole is thick enough that you can’t feel the stone (unless you’re some sort of mythical princess)
