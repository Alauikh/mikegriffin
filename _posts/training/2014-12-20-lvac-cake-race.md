The annual cake race was on yesterday. 
It's a handicapped race and first across the line wins a cake.

I was set off with Gavin, and 10 seconds behind Bren.
I tried to close the gap (too quickly as it turned out) and paid the price for it.
I ended up coming in 17th place in a slightly disappointing 17:58.
The problem was that I didn't feel like I was racing, more that I was out for a tempo run or the like.
There was no change of pace available and I couldn't react when Gavin went ahead.

There was a strong breeze in our faces as we went up along Chesterfield Avenue, but overall there was good running with only a couple of really wet patches on the course.

More training needed, and probably more sleep too!
