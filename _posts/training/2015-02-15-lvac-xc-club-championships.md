This is just a short report on how the race went.
The weather was as good as we could expect, with a bit of a headwind down the final straight.

There was a new course for the LVAC XC Club Championships this year.
We were spared some of the roots and a large hill, but we had to cross the Munichs instead.

Peter won the race, Damien was second and Chris was third. I finished in fifth, behind Bren and just ahead of Gavin, who almost caught me on the line.

The race went out as expected and I tried to hold on to the lead bunch for as long as I could.
I dropped off about half way through the first lap and shortly after Chris went past me.
I tried to stay with him, but he dropped me after a few hundred metres.
Shortly after that, I caught Gavin and went past him as strong as I could.
I didn't quite drop him as much as I wanted to though.

Bren came through on the third lap and passed me.
I stayed with him until the end of the Munichs but then totally died.
I felt like I was walking at this stage and had to dig really deep to keep going.

I wasn't strong enough on the day, but I hadn't slept well in the week leading up to it, Ã‰abha was teething and keeping us all awake.
This is no excuse, but more of a reason, if that makes sense to anyone else!
