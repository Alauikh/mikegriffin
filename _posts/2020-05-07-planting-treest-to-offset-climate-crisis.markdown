I've recently signed up to [Offset Earth](https://offset.earth) after following [Phil Sturgeon on Twitter](https://twitter.com/philsturgeon).
He's been going on about this site for ages and I eventually signed up and now have a family account set up where we get about 40 trees planted each month.

Offset have projects to plant trees and do other carbon ofsetting things to make it easy to help the climate.
There's a good dashboard that tells you more about the projects you've contributed to and how much carbon you've helped to reduce.

You can see out family forest at https://offset.earth/griffins and if you want to get started yourself, [use this link and we both get 10 extra trees](https://offset.earth/?r=5ea0c82962f64a00179ea048).
