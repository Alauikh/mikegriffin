A few months ago, I was looking around for a new way to host a few sites that
I have because my old provider was based in the states and most of my traffic
was from Europe. After going through what felt like a million sites that claimed
to have cheap or free hosting and turned out to be either time limited offers or
just plain unavailable, I stumbled across DigitalOcean.

When I found them, they had just upgraded all their accounts to SSDs and were 
pushing hard to get new people to try out their service. I jumped on board and
very soon had a virtual server of my own running away. Initially I set it up in
New York, but I was able to manually transfer it across the ocean to Amsterdam
with very little fuss.

I'm now using their service to host a few websites, some email accounts and even
use it every day to connect to IRC. I can have no complaints, they have fixed any
problems I had very promptly and they seem like a good group to work for. They
even have their own IRC channel at #digitalocean which is good for a laugh as well
as a way to ask for help and even help others with problems.

They recently launched a referrals program and [here's my link](https://www.digitalocean.com/?refcode=1b3cb64c1fbd)
if you'r interested in trying it out. I get $10 for every $10 you spend. That's 
**two whole months** of hosting on their lowest plan.

I have no other affiliation to them, but I would definitely recommend that you
try them out if you are in the market for a decent cloud based server.
