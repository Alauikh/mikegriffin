I've been making this bread for a few months now, since we bought a bag of the flour from [Green Earth Organics](https://www.greenearthorganics.ie).
Since we finished the bag, I've had to look up the recipe each time, and I'm always worried that it won't be there when I go to look for it!

This loaf has been a great hit with everyone, we tend to go through most of the loaf along with some home made soup each time it's around.

An to top it off, the smell reminds me of my Granny's house where whe made two loaves every morning and brown scones as well every weekend.
