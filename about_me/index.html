<p>My name is Mike Griffin. I'm married to my fantastic wife, Louise and I'm currently living in Celbridge, Co. Kildare.
I work for the <a href="http://www.museum.ie">National Museum of Ireland</a>, based out of Collins Barracks.</p>

<p>I play football with <a href="http://www.shannongaels.ie">Shannon Gaels</a> in Cavan. I also take part in
triathlons, duathlons, aquathons and I'll try my hand at any other race if I think I can get away with it. I
finished Ironman Lanzarote last year in under 11 hours.</p>

<p>I have represented Ireland in canoe polo at three European Championships and one World Championship. I played
internationally from 1999 until 2005. I played with Groningen for a season in 2002 before coming back and and
playing with Muppets in Ireland. I still play occasionally in Ireland. I am also an international referee.</p>
