title: "Biggest run month ever"

Last month was my biggest run month ever and I wasn’t even trying. I almost made it to 200 miles in old money (my target for the last few Decembers). I ran 25 times and did three races. My longest run was 21.5km but I did get a couple of other 18km runs in there at the start of the month.

The biggest thing for me was consistency. I ran four or five times every week and didn’t miss out on any of the weekday sessions. Keeping up this load is the goal now for this month. I didn’t cycle at all last month but I did play some football which I didn’t log. This month I will be cycling in to work at least once a week. I think it’ll be a good way to recover from any races that we do.
