I did the marathon on Monday in a PB time of 3:03:20. I just missed out on sub 3 because I didn’t do enough long training in the lead up to the race. My longest run was 13 miles!

Anyway, here are some photos of my medal, which I managed to break in less than two days. There’s supposed to be a ceramic logo on the front of the medal. I’ll see if I can get a picture of someone elses and post it up here.
