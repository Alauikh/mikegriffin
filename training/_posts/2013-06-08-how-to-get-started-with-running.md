I did a talk in work as part of a new thing I’m trying out. I’m trying to get people to give a short talk over lunchtime on Wednesdays and to get it all going, I’ve been giving talks on different things.

This week, I was asked if I would give a talk on “Getting Started With Running”. It was a bit thrown together and I didn’t have time to rehearse it properly so I have to apologise for all the umming and awwing. Here are the slides and video from it. Let me know what you think and any tips you have to improve my presentation style or the talk itself.
