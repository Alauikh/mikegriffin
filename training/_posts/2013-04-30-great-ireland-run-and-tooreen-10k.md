I ran with Kenenise Bekele!

He was in Dublin a few weeks ago to run the Great Ireland Run. This was also the AAI National 10k Championships. It was a windy and day but dry and not too cold. Head and cross winds were the order of the day and all the hills in the second half. I got through the first half in 17 minutes and finished in 35:04. I thought I was on for 34:xx until I crossed the line. I blame the oxygen deprivation from sprinting the last 400m!

The next weekend, there was a 10k in Tooreen in Mayo. David and Sinead were going to do it so myself and Louise decided to do it too. It was a small race but it turned out to be very enjoyable.

Louise finished first in the ladies category in a PB of 45 minutes. David finished about a minute back and Sinead finished in under an hour. After it all, we headed into the hall for cake, sandwiches and tea. A great spread put on by the local ladies and it went down really well.

Then it was back home to pig out on sweets, crisps and beer after a healthy salad. A good end to a good week.
