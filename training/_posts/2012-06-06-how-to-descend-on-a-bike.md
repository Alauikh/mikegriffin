Here’s a good article on how to descend and take corners properly. It’s different to how I have been doing it up to now, I was always under the impression that the apex cornering technique was the right way to do it. This guy says that that is all wrong. You should brake hard and early and then turn and finally power out.

I’m keeping it here so that I can read it a few times before trying it out the next time I get out on my bike.
